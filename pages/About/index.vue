        <p class="pist">My name is Vadym Zotov. I started my career as a software developer and reached a C-level position
          in leading IT outsourcing companies in Ukraine. When I was doing my MBA, I decided to try my hand in business.
          Together with my close friend, we started a little side project.</p>
        <p class="pist">Initially, our idea was to provide top quality code. You know offshore software development is
          often blamed for poor quality and we wanted to prove the contrary.</p>
        <p class="pist">We got a few orders and started working. It seemed to me that we accomplished our mission – our
          clients were satisfied with our work. We established friendly relations, they came to Kyiv to visit our office.
        </p>
        <p class="pist">And I got it – it’s not only the quality that makes service excellent, it’s the attitude.</p>
